# InTape backend

My old freelance project (made in 2022). Realizes backend for web3 nft social network InTape.
It was written in about 2 weeks, I received 700$ as payment.

It didn't launch, the project didn't live to release, so I decided to publish the code.
History is squashed into single commit.
